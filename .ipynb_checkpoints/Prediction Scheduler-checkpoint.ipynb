    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are setting up a job using schedule and time library of python which will get all the unprocessed images every minute and pass them through the predict function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are storing the weights of the trained CNN model and passing it to the predict function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries Used - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keras: Deep learning library in python. Used to perform convolution, pooling etc functions on images (explained in CNN model notebook.)\n",
    "2. Numpy: numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "3. Schedule and time: These libraries help in automating certain tasks and repeat them in certain intervals of time."
